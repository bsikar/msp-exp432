## Project Overview

2 States:
- 1 Security System Active:
    - The LED1 will be on and the LCD will say Active
    - If the IR sensor detects a person the Buzzer will go off
    - If the RFID reads the correct input the Buzzer stops and the LCD will say Inactive
    - If the FID reads the wrong input the LED2 increases value
        - The LED2 goes from 0 (off) to 7 (white)
        - If the LED2 hits white then the LCD will say 'Locked Out' and the RFID wont take any more input
        - To unlock it the system must be reset
- 2 Security System Inactive
    - The LED1 will be off and the LCD will say Inactive
    - If the RFID reads the correct input while the left button is pressed the LCD screen will say 'Activate?'
        - Then the Right button must be pressed to Activate the system, this will set the LED1 and LCD screen

## RFID-RC522 
1. **VCC**: This is the power supply pin. It's connected to a positive voltage source. For the RFID-RC522, this is usually a 3.3V power supply.

2. **RST**: This stands for Reset. It is used to reset the RFID module. Applying a low signal to this pin resets the internal states of the module.

3. **GND**: This is the Ground pin. It is connected to the ground of the power supply and is used as a reference point for all signals.

4. **MISO**: This stands for Master In Slave Out. It is used in SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication. This pin is used by the RFID module to send data back to the microcontroller.

5. **MOSI**: This stands for Master Out Slave In. It is also used in SPI communication. This pin is used by the microcontroller to send data to the RFID module.

6. **SCK**: This stands for Serial Clock. It is another pin used in SPI communication. This clock signal is provided by the microcontroller to synchronize data transmission between the microcontroller and the RFID module.

7. **NSS**: This stands for Negative Slave Select (also known as Chip Select or CS). It is used in SPI communication to activate the RFID module. It is typically active low, meaning the RFID module is selected for communication when this pin is pulled to a low logic level.

8. **IRQ**: This stands for Interrupt Request. This pin is used by the RFID module to alert the microcontroller of certain events (like the presence of an RFID tag in its vicinity). It is an optional connection, not always used in every project.
