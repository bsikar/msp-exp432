## Project Overview

NLP will be used on a RaspberryPi, then over UART 0, 1, 2 will be sent to the msp432p401r. 
This data will then turn on the LEDs, turn on/off a motor and turn on/off a buzzer if a sensor is active.
The LED will be set to a random value by using a noisy unconnected pin and reading ADC

## RFID-RC522 
1. **VCC**: This is the power supply pin. It's connected to a positive voltage source. For the RFID-RC522, this is usually a 3.3V power supply.

2. **RST**: This stands for Reset. It is used to reset the RFID module. Applying a low signal to this pin resets the internal states of the module.

3. **GND**: This is the Ground pin. It is connected to the ground of the power supply and is used as a reference point for all signals.

4. **MISO**: This stands for Master In Slave Out. It is used in SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication. This pin is used by the RFID module to send data back to the microcontroller.

5. **MOSI**: This stands for Master Out Slave In. It is also used in SPI communication. This pin is used by the microcontroller to send data to the RFID module.

6. **SCK**: This stands for Serial Clock. It is another pin used in SPI communication. This clock signal is provided by the microcontroller to synchronize data transmission between the microcontroller and the RFID module.

7. **NSS**: This stands for Negative Slave Select (also known as Chip Select or CS). It is used in SPI communication to activate the RFID module. It is typically active low, meaning the RFID module is selected for communication when this pin is pulled to a low logic level.

8. **IRQ**: This stands for Interrupt Request. This pin is used by the RFID module to alert the microcontroller of certain events (like the presence of an RFID tag in its vicinity). It is an optional connection, not always used in every project.
